      RWBY had been a long-standing concept of Oum's for years before it began development.
      Towards the end of his work on the 10th season of Rooster Teeth's Red vs. Blue,
      he developed the color-coding approach to character names and design as a hook for the series.
      During production on Red vs. Blue season 10, Oum asked series creator Burnie Burns
      if they could produce RWBY following the conclusion of that season.
      Burns, worried for the production schedule, told Oum "If you finish Season 10, then you can do whatever you want."
      Production on RWBY began as intended, with the first trailer being finished within two weeks and premiering after the credits of the
      Red vs. Blue season 10 finale on November 5, 2012.

      Oum designed the characters with assistance from artist Ein Lee,
      utilizing designs inspired by classic fairy tale characters.
      Each character has an associated color, and it is the first letters of the main character's colors,
      red, white, black, and yellow, that give the series its name.
      The characters' names also share the same letter and the meaning as the colour
      (e.g. "Weiss Schnee" translates to "snow white" in German).
      The series was originally written by Oum, along with fellow Rooster Teeth employees Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross.
      Oum was initially concerned about a story focusing on female characters being developed by a primarily male crew,
      but said they managed to do well developing the female characters.
      Regarding the design, Oum wanted to
      "present a two-dimensional, toon-shaded look, but with all of the depth and complexity of a 3D-animated production."
      Seasons 1 to 3 were animated by Rooster Teeth's internal animation team using Smith Micro's Poser software,
      out of assets built on Autodesk Maya.
      Starting in Season 4, episodes are now being animated in Maya.
      The series' music is composed by Jeff Williams,
      who previously composed the soundtracks for Seasons 8â€“10 of Red vs. Blue,
      and features vocals by Williams' daughter, Casey Lee Williams.

      A series of four promotional trailers, one for each lead character, were released.
      They were primarily produced by Oum and assistant animator Shane Newville.
      Each trailer begins by unveiling one of the four primary characters and then showing a detailed action sequence.
      The "Red" trailer was shown after the credits for Red vs. Blue's season 10 finale in November 2012.
      It was followed by the "White" trailer in February 2013.
      The "Black" trailer was unveiled at a <a href="http://east.paxsite.com">PAX East</a> panel at the end of March and was the first to include voice-acted dialogue.
      Following the premiere of the "Black" trailer, Oum noted with regret that the first two trailers were shorter and had less character development.
      The "Yellow" trailer was shown at Rooster Teeth's A-Kon panel on June 1, 2013.
      Music from the trailers was sold as digital downloads at several online retailers.
      On July 5, 2013, at the RWBY panel for their RTX 2013 event, Rooster Teeth premiered the first episode of RWBY,
      and would post the episode to their website on July 18.

      Following the premiere of RWBY in July 2013,
      Rooster Teeth posted new episodes for the first season, subtitled Volume 1,
      streaming weekly on their website, with access two hours early for their sponsors.
      The new episode would be uploaded to YouTube the next week.
      On August 16, 2013, streaming site Crunchyroll announced it would simulcast RWBY.
      Volume 1 ran for 16 episodes, varying in length.
      Volume 1 concluded in November 2013, and was then released to DVD and Blu-ray.

      The second season, subtitled Volume 2, was screened at RTX on July 4, 2014, and premiered on July 24.
      It consisted of 12 episodes, with the final episode released on October 30, after which it was released on DVD and Blu-ray.

      Volume 3 premiered on October 24, 2015 along with an episode of the RWBY backstory series World of Remnant.
      For Volume 4, Rooster Teeth producer and co-director Gray G. Haddock said that Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross were writing for the series.
      The season debuted on October 22, 2016. In January 2017, a fifth season was announced to be in development.

      The Blu-ray and DVD releases in Australia were handled by Hanabee Entertainment.
      On August 15, 2014, Rooster Teeth announced that a local Japanese dub was being developed by Warner Bros. Home Entertainment Japan.
      Rooster Teeth CEO Matt Hullum declared they would be marketing the show as an anime:
      "This is the first time any American-made anime has been marketed to Japan.
      It definitely usually works the other way around, and we're really pleased about that."
      Warner Bros. has also acquired local merchandising rights as well.
      The show was broadcast on Tokyo MX in 2017 under the title RWBY 1-3:
      The Beginning, which featured episodes from volumes 1 to 3 condensed into 13 episodes.
      On February 1, 2015, Rooster Teeth announced that both volumes of RWBY so far were available for streaming on Netflix.
      The first volume was released in the UK by Animatsu Entertainment on May 4, 2015, on DVD.

        <h4>Critical Response</h4></li>
          <p>
          Commentators discussing the promotional trailers lauded the show's animation style and its musical soundtrack.
          The trailers prompted enthusiastic anticipation for the series premiere.
          When the first episode premiered at RTX, it was popular with attendees to the point that seating was full at all three screenings.
          Amanda Rush, writing for Crunchyroll, noted the anime and Western influences of the series,
          and praised it as "quick-witted, exciting, lovely to look at" saying fans of anime would enjoy it.
          The Yakima Herald-Republic called it "thrilling" and "captivating" and praised its "beautiful" 3D character animation.
          The Austin Chronicle described the premiere as making Oum the "rock star" of Rooster Teeth.
          The series has reportedly contributed to a 9% increase in views for Rooster Teeth's official YouTube channel.
          Kotaku's Richard Eisenbeis praised the series for its clever use of fairytale elements,
          fun and enjoyable dialogue, and the fighting choreography, but was critical about the short nature of the episodes,
          stating that, "The biggest drawback in doing a micro-series...
          is that there is precious little time for good characterization".
          He was also critical of the technical issues of the animation,
          mentioning that the animation is good when the audience is unable to see the character's feet.
          He ends by saying that "RWBY is a good first step into a world of possibilities."

        <li><h4>Response to Marketing as an Anime</h4></li>
          <p>
          Reaction to Matt Hullum's statement made on August 15, 2014 about RWBY being an anime has been mixed.
          Lindsay Jones said "Funnily enough, we showed our Japanese cohorts RWBY and they started arguing about
          whether it was anime or not! But seeing the reception from audiences is so surreal, and we never expected it."
          A Movie Pilot blog listed the RWBY as anime topic among its "flame wars you don't want to be part of".
          Anime News Network writers Paul Jensen and James Beckett wrote:
          "We don't have any formal reviews of RWBY here on ANN,
          but it is kind of cool to see an American production make it to the release encyclopedia."
          Michael Mauer of The Cornell Daily Sun wrote that the issue was still being debated among the anime community,
          while Sabrina Pyun of ComicsVerse wrote "The show is known for many things,
          from its dubious status as an anime to its unique 3D animation style."
          However, mainstream news articles dated after Hullum's statement and previewing
          later seasons and the franchise have referred to RWBY as an American anime,
          including Variety, Collider, iDigitalTimes, Entertainment Weekly, Adweek, and Deadline.com.
