      RWBY had been a long-standing concept of Oum's for years before it began development.
      Towards the end of his work on the 10th season of Rooster Teeth's Red vs. Blue,
      he developed the color-coding approach to character names and design as a hook for the series.
      During production on Red vs. Blue season 10, Oum asked series creator Burnie Burns
      if they could produce RWBY following the conclusion of that season.
      Burns, worried for the production schedule, told Oum "If you finish Season 10, then you can do whatever you want."
      Production on RWBY began as intended, with the first trailer being finished within two weeks and premiering after the credits of the
      Red vs. Blue season 10 finale on November 5, 2012.

      Oum designed the characters with assistance from artist Ein Lee,
      utilizing designs inspired by classic fairy tale characters.
      Each character has an associated color, and it is the first letters of the main character's colors,
      red, white, black, and yellow, that give the series its name.
      The characters' names also share the same letter and the meaning as the colour
      (e.g. "Weiss Schnee" translates to "snow white" in German).
      The series was originally written by Oum, along with fellow Rooster Teeth employees Miles Luna and Kerry Shawcross.
      Oum was initially concerned about a story focusing on female characters being developed by a primarily male crew,
      but said they managed to do well developing the female characters.
      Regarding the design, Oum wanted to
      "present a two-dimensional, toon-shaded look, but with all of the depth and complexity of a 3D-animated production."
      Seasons 1 to 3 were animated by Rooster Teeth's internal animation team using Smith Micro's Poser software,
      out of assets built on Autodesk Maya.
      Starting in Season 4, episodes are now being animated in Maya.
      The series' music is composed by Jeff Williams,
      who previously composed the soundtracks for Seasons 8â€“10 of Red vs. Blue,
      and features vocals by Williams' daughter, Casey Lee Williams.
